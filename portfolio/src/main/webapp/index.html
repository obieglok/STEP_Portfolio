        <p> Welcome to my Portfolio page that I set up as part of my STEP 2020 Google Internship</p>
        <p> My <strong> fun fact </strong> about me is that I am one of the first ever participants of a <strong> Virtual Step 2020 Google Internship </strong> due to a global pandemic. </p>
        <p> Join me in this journey of becoming a very googley noogler at Google! Wish me Google luck! </p>

        <h1><strong>More</strong> About me</h1>
        <p> I am an incoming 3rd year student of Computer Science and Business in Trinity College Dublin. Ever since I stepped foot in Trinity, I knew it
        was the place where I wanted to study. Through series of ups and downs I have managed to secure a spot in this university. As a First Generation
        college student, I am extremely proud of this accomplishment. </p>
        <p>You may wonder and ask <em> but what made you choose your course?</em> Well let me tell you!</p>
        <p>Ever since I was young I used to sneak into my aunts room to turn on the computer and play around on it. Then when I was 7, I have received my first ever laptop and I
        believed that I would become a hacker. Unfortunately I haev alwasy found it hard to get started to learn html, java etc. I would have started a course but never finished it.
        Then in Transition Year I singed up to take part in Bridge 21 in Trinity. It was a week long programme in which you would get a chance to learn some coding. And the spark has been ignited ever since.
        From participating in many different weeks with Bridge 21, I was assured that CS what exactly the thing that I wanted to do. But, there was a problem called <em> Physics </em>.
        See, throughout school I loved Science, especially Biology and Chemistry, but I never took interest in physics. Upon reading all Computer Science courses I found out that
        physics plays an important role in them, and I just couldn't make myself sign up to do it. Upon further research I stumbled across CSB- Computer Science and Business course and I knew
        it was the right fit, and here I am!</p>
        <p> Throughout the past two years in college I have been actively involved in mentoring through Student to Student, Bridge 21 and TAP.
            Some of my tasks as a mentor include: going out to schools to give presentations, campus tours and helping TY students with coding. <em>Why do I do it? </em> Well I
            like to give back to my community and inspire other girls to join STEM. When I was younger I enjoyed hearing about college and peoples' experiences with it, and they inspired and motivated me.
            So now I would like to be that motivation for someone.</p>
        <p> This year I will be on Coder Dojo's Commitee looking after their Social Media! So stay tuned! </p>

        <h1> Projects! </h1>
        <p> If you would like to learn a little bit more about what projects I have completed, continue reading below! </p>
        <div class="project">
          <p><strong>Hand Gesture Recogniton Tool </strong> </p>
          <p> As part of my Software Enginering Module, my team mates and myself have created a Hang Gesture Recognition Tool. This tool allows you to use your
          computer mouse through a series of gestures. This limits the need to touch computer equipment which will lead to a decrease in cross-contamination risks.
          We were requested by a company called SureWash to complete this project and we hope it will get some good use!
          </p>
          <p>Some things I learned through it:
            <ul>
              <li>Your Client may not know what they are actually looking for. </li>
              <li>I realised command line isn't that bad!</li>
              <li>I learned more about OpenCV and Python</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        <div class="project">
          <p><strong>Portfolio Website </strong></p>

          <p> I have created this Portfolio for two main reasons:
            <ol>
              <li> To learn how to create websites and improve my HTML, CSS and Java Script. </li>
              <li> To have one dedicated place where I can show all my projects and achievements.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

        <div class="project">
          <p><strong>Tetris Game </strong> </p>
          <p>I have created a basic Tetris Game in JavaScript, in order to learn a little bit more about how to use JavaScript for games.</p>
          <p> You can play the game yourself <a href="https://obieglok.github.io/Tetris/"> here</a>.</p>
          <p>
            As this was my first JavaScript game over I managed to learn a lot!
            <ul>
              <li>How to write JavaScript functions. </li>
              <li>How to use forEach() functionality. </li>
